,Michigan Great Lakes Grids,"In the Great Lakes, grid systems defined by latitude and longitude minutes have been used for a number of decades as a fishery standard for data reporting. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Fisheries Division created this GIS layer in 2019 to depict the MDNR Michigan Great Lakes grid (v3.2) standard for Fisheries Division applications for the waters of the State of Michigan, and for Canadian waters in the St. Clair Detroit River System (SCDRS), as of June 2019. This GIS layer was created by incorporating grid boundaries and ID values from a number of existing grid standards.This layer is a composite grid that incorporates grid boundaries and ID values from the following GIS data standards for different areas of the Great Lakes: 1) 10-minute grids for Lakes Huron, Michigan, Superior and the St. Mary's River came from the Institute for Fisheries Research (IFR) version 1 (v1) of the 10-minute grids. 2) 10-minute grids for Lake Erie came from version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids created by the Great Lakes GIS (GLGIS) project, and 3) 5-minute grids for SCDRS came from 5-minute grids developed by the GLGIS project.Version 1 of the IFR 10-minute grids were created in 1998, and only covered Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, and the St. Mary's River. This is the GIS dataset that was used as the grid standard for the 2000 consent decree. The grid boundaries and ID values in v1 were based off of the paper maps depicted in the 1989 Status of the Fisheries Resource Report (Technical Review Committee, 1989) with some very minor grid boundary differences likely caused by bringing the paper map into a digital GIS format. In v1, 10-minute grids do not always have rectangular boundaries where each side represents 10-minutes of latitude and longitude, especially near the shoreline. In order to create the v3.2 composite layer, some features in the v1 GIS dataset that were missing ID values were assigned ID values based on historical creel maps or nearby grid ID values.Version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids was created in 2006 and provides coverage forall five Great Lakes, but only partial coverage in the connecting channels, with no coverage in SCDRS. In contrast to v1, 10-minute grids in this dataset are true 10-minute grids with rectangular sides that strictly follow 10-minute latitude and longitude lines (along with some cases where two true 10-minute grids were combined into one grid cell with one ID value). Due to the differences in grid boundaries, there are some different ID values across v1 and v2.The GLGIS 5-minute grid GIS dataset was created in 2006 at IFR. This layer contains rectangular 5-minute grids that are true 5-minute grids, with each side of every grid representing 5-minutes of latitude or longitude. 5-minute grids were used for SCDRS in v3.2 to align with historical data reporting standards in the region, and because there are no 10-minute grids that fully cover SCDRS. 5-minute grids created by the GLGIS only exist for SCDRS, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron, and the reason for this is unknown.SCDRS grids on the Canadian side of the basin are included in v3.2 for Fisheries Division data reporting needs that may include Canadian areas of SCDRS, but these grids in Canadian waters may not represent the standard that is actively used by Canadian agencies.In order to create the v3.2 composite, grid cells from the various GIS data sources were merged together for water bodies as specified above. In v3.2 the grids are almost exactly as they appear in the source data (with minor edits such as edge matching) except where 10-minute grids 602 and 603 in Lake Erie from Version 2 were replaced with GLGIS 5-minute grids. These grids cover the transition between the Detroit River and Lake Erie, where 10-minute grids are too large for some fisheries data reporting purposes. Therefore in v3.2, the two 10-minute grids were replaced with four 5-minute grids from the GLGIS 5-minute grid dataset. ID values were kept from the 5-minute grids for the two northern cells but the two southern grids cells retain ID values from the GLGIS v2 10-minute grids (602 and 603). This was done to allow continuity with historical data that has been recorded for 10-minute grids 602 and 603, but users need to be aware that these ID values in v3.2 are now associated with 5-minute grids instead of 10-minute grids.Version 3.2 was subsequently slightly altered to create Version 3.3, which replaced the shoreline in Northern Lake Huron and slightly altered the shoreline near the Soo Locks in the St. Mary's River to match zones, closures, etc. described in the Consent Decree that were depicted with a more detailed shoreline than the v3.2 shoreline. This was done so that those zones, closures, etc. could be depicted along with the Michigan Great Lakes Grids and have alligning shoerline depictions (see Figures 13, 12 & 16 for examples of the more detailed shoreline).GIS layer was last updated 10/01/2019.Metadata last updated 10/02/2019.",English,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,MichiganDepartmentofNaturalResources(MDNR)|GreatLakes|Grids|InstituteforFisheriesResearch(IFR)|5-minute|10-minute,2019-07-10T14:15:48.000Z,,,,,"-168.2359,69.8489,170.7831,76.1023",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_7,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_7.zip,,https://services3.arcgis.com/Jdnp1TjADvSDxMAX/arcgis/rest/services/dnrFisheries/FeatureServer/7,,6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_7,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_7,Michigan State University,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

,Maryland Coast Smart - Climate Ready Action Boundary (CRAB) Flood Depth Grid,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Imagery Layer for accessing the Maryland Coast Smart - Climate Ready Action Boundary (CRAB) data product.The Maryland Coast Smart - Climate Ready Action Boundary (CRAB) Flood Depth Grid raster layer was created using a GIS spatial analysis model, unique for each county in the State of Maryland. Coastal counties follow an analysis methodology that incorporates FEMA Stillwater wave action as it is understood from the FEMA identified VE zones. A Water Surface Elevation (WSE) and Still Water Elevation (SWEL) rasters are used as the baseline to identify existing water depths within each county. For all flood zones that are not classified as VE the WSE three feet was added to reflect a three-foot rise in the base flood elevations. For those WSEs falling within a FEMA floodplain identified V Zone, six feet was added (three feet for the increase in flood elevations for the CS-CRAB, and 3 feet to compensate for the minimum of 3 foot wave action typically mapped by FEMA) / wave heights greater than 3 feet were reduced to the 3 foot minimum for consistency across the shoreline. The newly calculated WSE plus three datasets were then converted to points and merged. Next, an Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) Interpolation was used to compute the proportional weighted values between the WSE point locations based on proximity. The DEM for each county is then subtracted from the new IDW raster in order to show precise water locations as they relate to the land elevation, producing a freeboard depth grid representing the depth of flood waters above the existing ground elevation given a 3 foot increase in water level. A course resolution QAQC was applied to remove ""islands"" of data associated with DEM inaccuracies and other elevation anomalies.The analysis was run at a 1 ft x 1 ft raster resolution. The DEM accuracy for each county varies based what is currently available. Here the breakdown of DEM accuracy for each county used in this project: Anne Arundel County DEM year is 2017 and horizontal resolution is 1ft. Baltimore County DEM year is 2015 and horizontal resolution is 2.5ft. Baltimore City DEM year is 2015 and horizontal resolution is 0.7m.

,Maryland Critical Areas - Critical Areas,"In 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Act to regulate development, manage land use and conserve natural resources on land in those areas designated as Critical Area. For this document, the Critical Area is all land and water areas within 1000 feet of the tidal waters' edge or from the landward edge of adjacent tidal wetlands and the lands under them. Georeferenced digital data files of the critical Area have been produced for Baltimore City and the 16 Maryland counties with land located within the Critical Area. The digital maps produced for each jurisdiction are polygons depicting the Critical Area and the land use classifications recognized by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC). Each jurisdiction is a separate file. The data were produced from hard copy parcel maps originally submitted by the counties as part of the requirements for developing their Critical Area Program. For the purpose of the Mdimap web service the Critical Area Data is displayed by two data layers, one general layer and one layer showing the available critical area data for local towns.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

,ACS 2019 Poverty Status Variables Tract,"This layer contains data from the American Community Survey (ACS) about poverty status by age group. These are 5-year estimates shown by tract boundaries. Poverty status is based on income in past 12 months of survey. Vintage: 2015-2019. Source data downloaded from https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html. Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value.
