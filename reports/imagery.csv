,2018 LiDAR - Hydro Enforced Digital Terrain Model (DTM) - Imagery Service,"Hydro Enforced DTMThe hydro-flattened bare earth DEM was generated using the 2018 DC lidar bare earth points and 3D hydro breaklines to a resolution of 1 m. The bare earth points that fell within 1NPS along the hydro breaklines were excluded from the DEM generation process and put into class 20 - ignored ground. This is analogous to the removal of mass points for the same reason in a traditional photogrammetrically compiled DTM. This process was done in batch using proprietary software. The technicians then used proprietary software for the production of the lidar-derived hydro-flattened bare earth DEM surface in initial grid format at 1 m GSD. Water bodies (inland ponds and lakes), inland streams and rivers, and island holes were hydro-flattened within the DEM. Once the initial, hydro-flattened bare earth DEM was generated, the tiles were checked to ensure that the grid spacing met specifications. The surface was also checked to ensure proper hydro-flattening.",English,"City of Washington, DC","Washington, District of Columbia",Aerial imagery,,DC|ImageService|Raster|LiDAR|2018|DTM|DigitalTerrianModel,2019-11-06T14:58:06.000Z,,,,"Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia|Maryland|Virginia","-77.1220,38.7855,-76.9007,39.0017",Image|Service,Image,Imagery,https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,,,,https://imagery.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/Lidar/Hydro_Enforced_DTM_2018/ImageServer,288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,University of Maryland,04c-01,04c-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The color files cover all of Kenosha, Ozaukee, Racine, Walworth, and Washington Counties, a large portion of Milwaukee County, and small portions of Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Rock, and Sheboygan Counties in Southeastern Wisconsin. The color orthophoto files were compiled at one-inch-equals-200-feet (1"" = 200') scale with a pixel resolution of twelve inches (12""). The color orthophoto files covering the northern townships of Milwaukee County (T8N-R21E and T8N-R22E) have a pixel resolution of six inches (6""). The image files are available in GeoTIFF or MrSID format. Each color GeoTIFF format file covers an area of 5,000 by 5,000 feet on the Wisconsin State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone, with zero overlap between images. There are a total of 2,514 GeoTIFF files in the data set with accompanying ""world"" ("".tfw"") files. The MrSID format files were prepared from mosaics of the GeoTIFF format files. Each color MrSID format file covers an area of one U.S. Public Land Survey System (USPLSS) township. The 59 MrSID format files contain imagery beyond the boundaries of the survey township and do overlap. The MrSID files have accompanying ""world"" ("".sdw"") files.
